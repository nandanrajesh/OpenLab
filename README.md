# Intelligent Layered Smart Door Lock System (MicroPython + Raspberry Pi)

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a **Smart Door Lock System** using a **Raspberry Pi Pico W** running **MicroPython**, integrating **HOG-based face recognition (off-device processing)**, **OTP-based fallback authentication**, and **real-time intruder alerts**. It features **multi-layered security** suitable for residential and commercial automation.

## üí° Key Features

- Face Recognition (pre-trained encoding using HOG - performed externally and stored in MicroPython-readable format)
- OTP Authentication via GSM fallback when face recognition fails
- Ultrasonic detection for presence sensing
- Relay-based solenoid lock control
- Buzzer alert on unauthorized access attempts
- SMS-based intrusion alerts using GSM
- Real-time feedback using LEDs
- Lightweight and cost-effective using MicroPython

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. **User Detected**:
   - Ultrasonic sensor triggers the system when someone approaches.

2. **Face Recognition Phase**:
   - External Pi system captures image, performs HOG-based face recognition.
   - Encoded data sent (or preloaded) to Pico W for identity verification.

3. **OTP Phase (Fallback)**:
   - If face not recognized, Pico W sends OTP via GSM module.
   - User enters OTP on keypad.
   - On success ‚Üí unlocks solenoid lock.  
   - On multiple failures ‚Üí buzzer alert + SMS sent to owner.

4. **Access Logging & Feedback**:
   - Green LED: Access granted.
   - Red LED + Buzzer: Access denied/intruder alert.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Flash MicroPython** to your Raspberry Pi Pico W using [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).
2. **Upload Files**:
   - Use Thonny‚Äôs File Manager to upload `.py` scripts.
3. **Connect Components** according to your circuit diagram.
4. **Run `main.py`** from Thonny or auto-start via `boot.py`.

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

| Scenario                        | Outcome                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Authorized face recognized      | Door unlocks                     |
| Face not recognized ‚Üí OTP       | User receives SMS, unlocks on success |
| Multiple wrong OTPs             | Buzzer activates, SMS alert sent |
| No person in range              | System idle                      |

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Mobile app or web UI for door control and logs
- Cloud storage for access logs and face recognition
- Battery backup for power failure scenarios
- Deep Learning model (if offloaded to Pi 4 or Jetson Nano)
- Anti-spoofing with liveness detection (e.g., blink or depth sensing)
